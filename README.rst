IAA-CSIC Phone Book
===================

This Python script, ``iaa-phone``, serves as the *white pages* of the `Institute of Astrophysics of Andalusia <http://www.iaa.es>`_ (CSIC, Spain). It is a command-line application that queries the website in order to find the telephone number given a name or surname. Associate researchers are also included in the search, unlike visiting ones, which are not currently listed in the general alphabetical list.

The reverse telephone directory (*grey pages*) is also available, as searches may also be done by the phone number or e-mail address.

All searches are case- and accent-insensitive.
